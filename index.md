<h4 style="text-align:center;">
Distracted by politics and problems, we've been living in a reality of fear.
</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">Our city has been carrying an aura of violence, uncertainty and discontent, hearts stirring against one another.

<blockquote style = "text-align:center;">But, you know.. <br>
Right now, in this moment. You are <b> Okay </b>.
</blockquote>
<br><br>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Your World is beautiful! Your Life is Beautiful! </h2>

<!--<blockquote style = "text-align:center;">--> <p style="text-align:center;"> And, you know.. <br>
<b> everything is going to be okay.</b> </p>
<!--</blockquote>-->
<br><br><br>
<p style="text-align:center;">You can take a moment for yourself sometimes to just <b>stop</b> and <b>breathe</b>.  </p>
<br><br><br>

##### Remember, your reality is whatever you want it to be.<br> This is your world, your future, to create whatever you desire,<br> create whatever life you want to live.

 If 2019 seems dark, search for a brighter perspective!<br>
Just remember, you're worth it. <!--And I'll let you in on a secret, _you are love_. -->

Now, I don't know where you're at in life or where you're going, but I hope these reminders help you in some way.
